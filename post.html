                <h6>Overview:</h6>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to classification and security reasons, I can’t show the work I did for the U.S. Air Force - Torque product. So for now, you’ll have to forgive me for not including images of final products, figma prototypes, or snippets of user research and usability testing done during the nearly 3 years of experience I have there. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am lead UX designer for both the Aircraft Schedule and Ready Aircraft Metric (RAM) products. My efforts were to add new features to the already in progress Aircraft Schedule product and completely design a UI for the newly added RAM product. Here are some notes about the project itself, the design process, and the impact I had on these projects.

                <h6>What Is Torque?</h6>
                <p>
                    Simply put Torque is a web app that is replacing airmen's complex excel files with a modern day online tool to help them get their job done faster and more efficiently. Now don’t get me wrong these excel files were impressive to say the least but they also had some flaws. Here’s a list of the pros and cons to help capture this idea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Pros:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infinitely customizable.</li>
                        <li>Delivered data in a well structured format.</li>
                        <li>Free.</li>
                        <li>It’s what they have been using for years.</li>
                        <li>Easy to print and email.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Cons:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formatting took a lot of time.</li>
                        <li>Not everyone was an excel super user.</li>
                        <li>Troubleshooting formulas.</li>
                        <li>Little to no standardization.</li>
                        <li>Lots of room for user error.</li>
                        <li>Constant need for updating multiple files, because information changes almost hourly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In light of all that Torque was created, and about a year and a half later after it started, I was brought onto the project. I was assigned to the Aircraft Schedule team then later on the RAM team.

                <ol>
                    <li>Explore: We would conduct extensive user research with airmen and Air Force leadership to gather requirements and context relevant to that branch of the Air Force, base, and/or aircraft type.</li>
                    <li>Define: Write a clear problem statement, and solution objective. Followed by a walk through document or user flow, and low fidelity wireframes that experiment with the proof of concept. After all that is completed we would conduct the first round of usability testing.</li>
                    <li>Design: Create high fidelity designs and/or prototypes in Figma. Gather feedback from PM’s and other designers. Refine then conclude with one more round of usability testing before the feature is handed off to the team for development.</li>

                    <li>Due to extensive research became a subject matter expert for the Aircraft Schedule application.</li>
                    <li>10 + new features added to the UI that allow for more accurate data, and saves 1-3 hours per week of time saved.</li>
                    <li>Coordinated with the PM, and developers to ensure the requirements, vision, and deadlines were met.</li>
                    <li>Demo the application to new users both virtually and in person.</li>
