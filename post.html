                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to classification and security reasons, I can’t show the work I've for the U.S. Air Force - Torque. So for now, you’ll have to forgive me for not including images of final products, figma prototypes, or snippets of user research and usability testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently the UX designer for the Fleet Management team, was previously on the Aircraft Schedule team as the designer. I also  and another pr products. My efforts were to add new features to the already in progress Aircraft Schedule product and completely design a UI for the unnamed product. Here are some notes about the project itself, the design process, and the impact I had on these projects.

                <h6>What Is Torque?</h6>
                <p>
                    Simply put Torque is a web app that is replacing airmen's complex excel files. This modern day tool helps airmen get their job done faster and more efficiently by standardizing their practices and keeping everything in one place. Now don’t get me wrong these excel files were impressive to say the least but they also had some flaws. Here’s a list of the pros and cons to help capture this idea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Pros of Excel:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infinitely customizable.</li>
                        <li>Delivered data in a well structured format.</li>
                        <li>Free.</li>
                        <li>It’s what they have been using for years.</li>
                        <li>Easy to print and email.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Cons of Excel:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formatting took a lot of time.</li>
                        <li>Not everyone was an excel super user.</li>
                        <li>Troubleshooting formulas.</li>
                        <li>Little to no standardization.</li>
                        <li>Lots of room for user error.</li>
                        <li>Constant need for updating multiple files, because information changes almost hourly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In light of all that Torque was created, and about a year and a half later after it started, I was brought onto the project. I was assigned to the Aircraft Schedule team then later on the unnamed team.

                <h6>The Design Process:</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>Explore: We would conduct extensive user research with airmen and Air Force leadership to gather requirements and context relevant to that branch of the Air Force, base, and/or aircraft type.</li>
                    <li>Define: Write a clear problem statement, and solution objective. Followed by a walk through document or user flow, and low fidelity wireframes that experiment with the proof of concept. After all that is completed we would conduct the first round of usability testing.</li>
                    <li>Design: Create high fidelity designs and/or prototypes in Figma. Gather feedback from PM’s and other designers. Refine then conclude with one more round of usability testing before the feature is handed off to the team for development.</li>
                </ol>
